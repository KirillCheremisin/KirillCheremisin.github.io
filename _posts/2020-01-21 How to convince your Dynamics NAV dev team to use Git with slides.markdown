Hi there!

Time is going fast, changing processes, tools and development approach around us. CI/CD, tooling, serverless, DevOps, DevSecOps, ArchOps and all these “ops” are not only buzzwords anymore. The base of them is Git. If you google “why do I need Git”, most of the articles will describe the difference between Git and other systems, the difference between centralised and decentralised/distributed version control systems, but it’s not easy to understand why do you really need to use Git when you get used to working without it. The article is dedicated to those of us who are still confused about these words (especially the “Git” word).

In Dynamics NAV world some of us still develop as years before and face the same problems: how to make fewer mistakes, how to deliver and deploy faster, how to control our code. The answer is simple: Git + automated testing.

The details is under [link][medium-link].
