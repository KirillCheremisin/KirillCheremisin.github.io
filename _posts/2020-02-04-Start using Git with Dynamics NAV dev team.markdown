Hi team!
Primarily the article is dedicated to Dynamics NAV developers which are aware of Git but still donâ€™t know how to start. I think the article will be also useful for different types of developers and users.

In the previous article, I described how to convince your team to use Git. Here I will try to describe the easiest way to start.

The details are under the [link][medium-link].
