Hi there!

In short, the article is dedicated to covering export XML with automated tests.
In the article I describe how to test export, how can you get automated tests usefull while refactoring or expanding functionality, how to expand existing functionality without breaking it down.

The most important points:
1. Tests help you to keep covered functions working;
2. Use events to skip unnecessary behaviour;
3. Use manual event subscriptions in tests;
4. Divide work to small steps (the code above could be refactored into smaller pieces with the help of tests);
5. Use buffered data to allow the use of functionality from different places.

The whole article with the screens and pictures you can read [here][medium-link].
